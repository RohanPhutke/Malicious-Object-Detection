# Malicious-Object-Detection
Developed a malicious object detection system using YOLOv8 for initial detection. Refined results by analyzing image depth with Depth_Anything_v2 to verify object presence. Finally, classified detected objects as real or fake using a YOLO-based classifier, ensuring accurate and reliable detection.
